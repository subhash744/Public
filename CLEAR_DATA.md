# Clear All Fake Data - Instructions

## The Problem
You're seeing fake profiles (like Blake Robinson) because they were stored in your browser's localStorage **before** we disabled the auto-initialization feature.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Clear Your Browser Data

### Option 1: Use Browser DevTools (Recommended)
1. **Open your website** (http://localhost:3001)
2. **Press F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **"Application"** tab (Chrome) or **"Storage"** tab (Firefox)
4. Click **"Local Storage"** in left sidebar
5. Click **"http://localhost:3001"**
6. Click **"Clear All"** button or right-click → **"Clear"**
7. **Refresh the page** (F5)

### Option 2: Use Dev Tools Page
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dev-tools
2. Click **"Reset All Data"** button
3. Refresh the page

### Option 3: Manual JavaScript Clear
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Paste this command:
```javascript
localStorage.clear(); location.reload();
```
3. Press Enter

## Verify Clean State

After clearing, you should see:
- ✅ **Landing Page** - No auto-login, just "Create Profile" button
- ✅ **Leaderboard** - Empty state with "No profiles yet"
- ✅ **Hall of Fame** - "The Hall Awaits" message
- ✅ **Dashboard** - Not accessible (need to create profile first)

---

## For Production Deployment

When you deploy to Vercel, this won't be an issue because:
1. Each visitor has their own fresh localStorage
2. Mock data initialization is disabled
3. No fake profiles will ever appear

---

## Permanent Prevention

I've already:
- ✅ Removed `initializeMockData()` from landing page
- ✅ No auto-generation of fake users
- ✅ Dev-tools hidden in production
- ✅ All placeholder images removed

The fake data you're seeing is just leftover from testing. Clear localStorage and you'll have a completely clean slate!
