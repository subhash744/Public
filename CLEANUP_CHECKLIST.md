# Production Cleanup Checklist

This document lists all placeholder content and references that should be replaced before going live with real users.

---

## üö® CRITICAL - Already Removed

### ‚úÖ Mock Data & Fake Profiles
- [x] Auto-initialization of 15 fake user profiles (REMOVED from landing page)
- [x] Featured builders showing fake profiles (REMOVED - only shows when real users exist)
- [x] Mock data generation on first visit (DISABLED)

---

## üìù Placeholders Still Present (For Future Cleanup)

### 1. **Placeholder Images** (Used as Fallbacks)

#### Component: `components/project-card.tsx`
- **Line 54:** `/placeholder.jpg` - Fallback for project banners when user doesn't provide one
- **Recommendation:** Keep as fallback OR replace with a default "No Image" graphic

#### Component: `app/profile-creation/page.tsx`
- **Line 160:** `/placeholder.jpg` - Fallback for user avatars during profile creation
- **Recommendation:** Keep as fallback OR use initials-based avatar generator

#### Component: `components/testimonials-section.tsx`
- **Line 87:** `/placeholder.jpg` - Fallback for testimonial images
- **Status:** Currently using real Vercel-hosted images, placeholder is just safety fallback
- **Recommendation:** Keep as fallback

---

### 2. **Landing Page Components (Marketing Content)**

These components contain placeholder SVG references for marketing visuals. They're used on the landing page but NOT in the core leaderboard functionality.

#### Component: `components/effortless-integration.tsx`
- **Lines 38-51:** Multiple `/placeholder.svg` references for integration visuals
- **Status:** Marketing component - not used in leaderboard app
- **Recommendation:** Remove entire component if not needed, OR replace with real integration screenshots

#### Component: `components/numbers-that-speak.tsx`
- **Lines 45-48:** `/placeholder.svg` references for dashboard visuals
- **Status:** Marketing component - not used in leaderboard app
- **Recommendation:** Remove entire component if not needed, OR replace with real dashboard screenshots

#### Component: `components/smart-simple-brilliant.tsx`
- **Lines 113, 154, 242, 283:** `/placeholder.svg` references for feature images
- **Status:** Marketing component - not used in leaderboard app
- **Recommendation:** Remove entire component if not needed, OR replace with real feature screenshots

---

### 3. **Mock Data Files (For Developer Testing)**

#### File: `lib/init-mock-data.ts`
- **Status:** DISABLED - No longer auto-runs on first visit
- **Purpose:** Can be manually triggered via `/dev-tools` for testing
- **Recommendation:** Keep for development/testing, ensure it's hidden in production

#### File: `scripts/generate-mock-data.ts`
- **Status:** Development tool only
- **Recommendation:** Keep for testing purposes

---

### 4. **Dev Tools Page**

#### File: `app/dev-tools/page.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Testing utilities (seed data, reset data, simulate traffic)
- **Status:** Accessible at `/dev-tools`
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Option A: Hide behind authentication in production
  - Option B: Remove route completely for production
  - Option C: Add environment check to disable in production

---

### 5. **Example URLs & Mock Links**

#### In `lib/init-mock-data.ts` (when manually triggered):
- `https://github.com/[username]/project-X` - Mock project links
- `https://[username].com` - Mock personal websites
- Mock social media handles

**Status:** Only generated when developer manually seeds data via dev tools
**Recommendation:** Keep as is - won't affect real users

## üìä Current State After Cleanup

### What Users See on First Visit (No Auto-Login):
1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - Clean hero section
   - "Create Profile" and "View Leaderboard" buttons
   - No fake users, no auto-login

2. **Leaderboard** (`/leaderboard`)
   - Empty state (no featured builders if no users exist)
   - Clean leaderboard tabs
   - Prompts to create first profile

3. **Hall of Fame** (`/hall`)
   - Centered title and description ‚úÖ
   - Empty state with "Join the OG Builders" frames only
   - No fake profiles

4. **Profile Creation** (`/profile-creation`)
   - 8-step wizard for new users
   - Clean, professional onboarding

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Against Fake Data

### Current Safeguards:
1. Mock data initialization is REMOVED from landing page
2. Featured builders only show when real users exist
3. Dev tools require manual access at `/dev-tools`
4. All placeholder images are fallbacks only

### Recommendations:
1. In production, add environment check:
   ```typescript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
     // Disable dev tools
     // Disable mock data seeding
   }
   ```

2. Consider adding a "Welcome" flow for first user:
   - Show tutorial/guide
   - Explain how to earn badges
   - Show example profile structure

## üìù Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Fixed:
- No auto-login on first visit
- No fake profiles generated automatically
- Hall of Fame title is centered
- Clean, production-ready user experience

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Remains (Intentional):
- **Fallback placeholder images** - Safe to keep, only show when user doesn't upload custom images
- **Marketing components** - Contain placeholder SVGs but are optional components
- **Dev tools** - Useful for testing, should be hidden in production

### üéâ Ready for Real Users:
The core leaderboard functionality is now 100% clean and ready for real users. No fake data will appear unless manually triggered via dev tools.
